	Fresh Onions runs on two servers, a frontend host running the database and hidden service web site, and a backend host running the crawler. Probably most interesting to the reader is the setup for the backend. TOR as a client is COMPLETELY SINGLETHREADED. I know! It's 2017, and along with a complete lack of flying cars, TOR runs in a single thread. What this means is that if you try to run a crawler on a single TOR instance you will quickly find you are maxing out your CPU at 100%.
	</p>
	<p>
	The solution to this problem is running multiple TOR instances and connecting to them through some kind of frontend that will round-robin your requests. The Fresh Onions crawler runs eight Tor instances.
	</p>
	</p>
	Debian (and ubuntu) comes with a useful program "tor-instance-create" for quickly creating multiple instances of TOR. I used Squid as my frontend proxy, but unfortunately it can't connect to SOCKS directly, so I used "privoxy" as an intermediate proxy. You will need one privoxy instance for every TOR instance. There is a script in "scripts/create_privoxy.sh" to help with creating privoxy instances on debian systems. It also helps to replace /etc/privoxy/default.filter with an empty file, to reduce CPU load by removing unnecessary regexes.

	Additionally, this resource <a href="https://www.howtoforge.com/ultimate-security-proxy-with-tor"</a>https://www.howtoforge.com/ultimate-security-proxy-with-tor</a> might be useful in setting up squid. If all you are doing is crawling and don't care about anonymity, I also recommend running TOR in tor2web mode (required recompilation) for increased speed.
